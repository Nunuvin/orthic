## Reading Material
One of the best ways to sharpen your Orthic is reading texts written in Orthic.

### Fully-Written Style
Texts in the fully-written style are hard to come by.
Most writing is done in a more abbreviated style.
But there are some!

- ["Specimen of Fully-Written Style"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/manual/FullyWrittenStyleSpecimen.png) from the Manual, written by Callendar around 1891 (1 page)
  - Key: [Manual Section]({{site.baseurl}}/manual#specimen-of-fully-written-style)
- [_The Cask of Amontillado_]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/reading/Cask of Amontillado 2020 Sherman.pdf) by Edgar Allan Poe, written by Jeremy W. Sherman in early 2020 (14 pages)
  - Key: [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Late_Edgar_Allan_Poe/Volume_1/The_Cask_of_Amontillado)

### Ordinary Style
Texts in the ordinary style are much easier to come by.
There are numerous specimens between the Manual and Supplement, as well as several texts published by the Cambridge Shorthand Society in the late 19th century or early 20th.
