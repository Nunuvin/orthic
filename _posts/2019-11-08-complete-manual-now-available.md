The [entire Orthic _Manual_]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/manual) is now available. If you were waiting for the whole shebang before diving in, wait no more!

This includes, for the first time, a [transcription of the _Hints for the Reporting Style._]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/manual#hints-for-the-reporting-style) While requiring you to read ordinary style well enough was a great gating mechanism, it made it harder for someone evaluating the system to suss out the speed potential. Well, no more!

I'll come back to clean up the earlier images later -- you'll notice that they are much more to scale the further on you get -- but for now, I'm going to focus on digitizing the _Supplement_ published a year after the _Manual,_ so that the complete system will be available.

If you notice any errors, please do reach out to `me at jeremy w sherman dot com`.

If you've any questions, drop by the [Orthic subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/orthic).
