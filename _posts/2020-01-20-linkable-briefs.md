Helping fellow writers master Orthic's shortcuts just got easier: The _Manual_ now sports links for each brief, ending, and joining. The _Supplement_ too now has links to each brief. (It already had links for its endings and beginnings, since they made it to the table of contents.)

The [briefs][] and [endings][] are their own self-links, for easy copy-paste when talking about them with other writers. They also follow a predictable pattern in anchor naming, so that the brief for "down" is at `#down-brief` and the ending for "ward" is at `#ward-ending`.

The letters and significant joins have links collected at the top of the ["How to Write and Join the Characters"][joins] section. These mostly follow the pattern set by "nsp" having the anchor `#nsp-join`, but some editorial decisions led to names like "U versus EE" (which gets `#u-versus-ee-join` as its anchor).

[briefs]: {{ 'manual#abbreviations-for-common-words' | relative_url }}
[endings]: {{ 'manual#abbreviate-common-endings' | relative_url }}
[joins]: {{ 'manual#how-to-write-and-join-the-characters' | relative_url }}
