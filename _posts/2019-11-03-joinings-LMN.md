You can now read about joining letters L, M, and N in _[The Manual]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl | append: "/manual" }})._

L and N have the most joining examples. L has many examples of L joins versus R joins. N just shows up in a lot of consonant clusters.

We'll revisit MB and NCH in the _Orthic Supplement,_ where a year's usage will have led to simpler forms for these blends.
