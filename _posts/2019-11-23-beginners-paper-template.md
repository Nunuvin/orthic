Callendar advises practicing with double-ruled paper to start in ["The Two Sizes of Character"]({{site.baseurl}}/manual#the-two-sizes-of-character). Now you can print your own! [Download the template here.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/paper/beginner's%20ruled%20paper%20(US%20letter).pdf) 

The template is also linked from that section of the _Manual._

This is definitely intended as "beginner’s" paper. It’s Pitman-ruled (meaning, 1/2 inch per line) with a generous inter-line spacing of 1/4 inch. The specimens seem to follow a similar inter-line spacing, but their line height is definitely less than the 1/2 inch here.

You'll find there are actually more than two rules: I have added 1/8-inch quarter-lines as a guide when writing the short characters N, M, T, D, R, L, and W, as well as a top-of-line rule. It looks much busier than Callendar's double-ruled paper, but it's also a big help in getting the proportions right when writing.

One surprise as I made this was that, for all the _Manual_ directs you to make the larger character **three times** the length of the shorter character in pairs like S/P, T/D, A/O, etc., in practice, Callendar clearly only wrote the larger characters **double** the length of the shorter, if that - sometimes T and D seem to be only say 1/8 inch vs 3/8 inch wide. For myself, I plan to do as he did, not as he said.
