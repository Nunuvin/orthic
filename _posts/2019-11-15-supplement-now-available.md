The [entire Orthic _Supplement_]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/supplement) is now available. This supplement adds to the manual everything the Orthic community had learned through a year of real-world use. Several shortcuts used in reporting proved robust enough to also be used in correspondence, so this book teaches how to write that more abbreviated ordinary style. It also shares some new tips for keeping up with a fast speaker while writing Orthic.

As with the _Manual's_ 'Hints for the Reporting Style', I have transcribed the _Supplement's_ [_Notes on Reporting_]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/supplement#key) for your ready reading.

Share and enjoy!
