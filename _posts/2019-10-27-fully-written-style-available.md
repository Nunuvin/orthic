Most everything you need to learn the fully-written style of Orthic is now available. I'll soon be adding the chapter on joining rules, which answers questions you'll run across in writing like, "If I need to write 'boat', how do I tell it from 'bot' or 'bat'?" (You write "bot" then add an A above the end of the O, and so for all OA pairs.)
