# Accelerate your handwriting for the information age
You can out-type your pen any time.

Or you could, before Orthic shorthand.

Orthic replaces the multi-step letters of your preschool alphabet with a Cambridge University-minted alphabet tuned for rapid yet legible writing. It's quick, compact, and still readable over a century later.

# Want to write even faster?
Orthic's got extra shortcuts to boost your speed. Write less, say more: that's Orthic.
