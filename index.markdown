# Accelerate your handwriting for the Information-age
Pen vs phone is no contest. You can out-type your pen any time.

Or you could, before Orthic shorthand.

Orthic replaces the slow, multi-step letters of the Roman alphabet you learned in pre-school with a Cambridge University-minted alphabet tuned for rapid yet legible writing. It's quick, compact, and readable a century later.

Want to write even faster? Orthic's got extra shortcuts to boost your speed. Write less, say more: that's Orthic.
