## Preface

It is now nearly a year since the publication of _Orthographic Cursive._
The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author's expectations,
and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.

The want of a brief and convenient title for the system has been very generally felt.
It has been decided to adopt the title of 'Orthic' in place of the somewhat cumbrous 'Orthographic Cursive.'

A society called the 'Cambridge Shorthand Society' has recently been started for the study and propagation of Orthic.
It has been placed under the management of Mr W. Stevens, of the Commercial and Technical Institute, Ranelagh Road, Ealing, W.
Manuscript magazines are, at present, circulated among the members,
and serve to provide practice in reading and writing the system.
It is hoped shortly to publish a magazine printed in Orthic,
and to establish a central school in London for the benefit of clerks and others who wish to perfect themselves in the reporting style,
and to utilise the system for business purposes.
In the meantime teaching for various centres can be arranged with Mr Stevens, the Principle of the Ealing Institute.

# Supplement to the Manual of Orthic

## Introduction

The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of the methods of abbreviation given in the _Manual_ [as "Hints for the Reporting Style"]({{M}}#hints-for-the-reporting-style) and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.

Some students appear to think that a phonetic system must necessarily be briefer and simpler than an orthographic.
Others appreciating the superior simplicity of the orthographic method are apt to wonder why shorthand was ever made phonetic.
It has therefore been thought necessary to explain these points more fully for the benefit of those who may not have read the author's previous publications on the subject.


## Advantages of the Orthographic Basis

An _Orthography,_ that is to say a definite standard of spelling, is the necessary groundwork of any practical system of writing.
It is essential, both for the sake of rapid automatic writing and to secure ease and certainty in reading, that each word should always be spelt in the same way.
In this way alone can it be written without conscious thought, and read without hesitation.

The author has insisted on this point, and illustrated it at some length in previous publications, particularly in the introduction to the _Manual of Cursive Shorthand[^1]_ (Phonetic).
Every word of that introduction will apply equally to the present system, except that it is orthographic and not phonetic.
The student who wishes thoroughly to master the principles of Orthic, and to learn how and why it differs from other systems of shorthand, will find in the introduction to the _Phonetic Manual_ much that is interesting and instructive, and that will be of material assistance to him.
The proof and explanation of the above statement, having been already given therein, need not be repeated here.
It is only necessary to point out its bearing on the question of an orthographic as opposed to a phonetic basis for shorthand.

[^1]: Published by C. J. Clay and Sons, price 2_s_.

Every system of shorthand must in one sense be orthographic.
There must be a correct outline for each word.
Every departure from this rule entails a certain loss of efficiency, and a systematic violation of it results in hopeless confusion.

It is evidently much simpler, if possible, to adopt the commonly received orthography as the basis of spelling for a shorthand system, than to elaborate a new phonetic standard.
The common spelling is already familiar to everyone, and is a practically perfect standard in point of strictness and uniformity.
Phonetic spelling, on the other hand, is to many people extremely distasteful and difficult to learn.
It is, moreover, even when learnt, an uncertain and unsatisfactory standard[^2] owing to varieties and changes of pronunciation.

[^2]: See _A System of Phonetic Spelling,_ pp. 17 and 21, by H. L. Callendar, published by Clay and Sons, 1889, price 6_d_.

That is the main and decisive point.
The simplicity and definiteness obtained by adopting the orthographic basis make it far preferable for general use to the phonetic.
There are several minor advantages, however, which should not be overlooked.

A phonetic system is quite unable to cope with any peculiarities of spelling, or to give any adequate representation of proper names.
It is also very difficult to adapt to the pronunciation of a foreign language.
Orthic, as [shown in the _Manual,_]({{M}}#application-to-foreign-languages) can be used, almost without change, for writing any foreign language that is spelt with the common alphabet.

Another very practical advantage of Orthic is that all the familiar longhand abbreviations can be at once utilised.
The majority of the examples given in the list of ["Examples of Abbreviations"](#examples-of-abbreviations) are simply transliterations of those in common use, and being already familiar require no learning.

It is commonly urged in favour of phonetic spelling that so much is gained in point of shortness by the omission of mute and silent letters, and by using simple signs for diphthongs and other compound sounds.
This argument as applied to shorthand is somewhat misleading.
All phonetic methods of abbreviation, such as _tho_ for _though,_ _brot_ for _brought_ etc., in so far as they are convenient and clear, are naturally utilised in any orthographic system.
Common diphthongs and combinations are also naturally represented by simple curves.
The characters of the orthographic alphabet can also be grouped on the principle of representing similar sounds by similar signs, thus securing whatever advantages a phonetic system may claim in this respect.

From the inventor's point of view, the real advantage of a phonetic system lies in the fact that it is much easier _to construct._
The early inventors could not find sufficient material for their alphabets in the way of characters that would join easily and clearly.
They got out of the difficulty by rejecting what they called duplicate or superfluous letters, such as _c, j, q, x,_ and by omitting all the vowels, or expressing them by detached marks.
This was really only a method of cutting the Gordian knot, and could not result in the production of a system adequate and suitable for general use.
The comparative case of constructing a system on this basis is, however, undoubtedly the true explanation of the extraordinary prevalence of systems of this type.

It is much more difficult to find sufficient stenographic material for a _complete_ phonetic system, providing joined characters for both vowels and consonants.
The difficulty of constructing a complete _orthographic_ system is of the same kind, but greater, owing to the great number and variety of different combinations to be provided for.

As early as 1887 the author fully recognised the advantages of an orthographic basis in point of simplicity, and had made many unsuccessful attempts to construct such a system; but at the time of writing the introduction of the _Manual_ he did not _fully_ realise the difficulties that phonetic spelling presents to the majority of students.
He was therefore content to abandon his orthographic labours, and to acquiesce in the generally prevailing opinion (as expressed in the _Manual,_ p.&nbsp;19) that a system of shorthand to be simple, consistent and complete must be phonetic, since it is _almost impossible_ to make a system represent consistently and simply the endless variety of combinations in the common spelling.
A correction in the above passage suggested by two or three eminent shorthand authorities, conducted in striking out the word 'almost' before impossible.
The author however, having at length succeeded in solving the problem to his own satisfaction, is now of the opinion that he had somewhat over-rated the impossibility.

Very shortly after the publication of _Cursive,_ it became evident that the difficulties of the majority of learners were almost entirely phonetic, that the system was otherwise extremely simple and very easily acquired.
The author therefore set to work again in a more systematic way.
A most elaborate analysis was made of the common spelling of English and several foreign languages.
The relative frequencies and modes of occurrence of all the possible combinations of letters were tabulated.
By means of this table a great variety of different methods and arrangements of characters were tested and rejected, or emended and improved.
After about a year of trial and failure an alphabet was at length evolved, capable of satisfying all the conditions previously laid down.

Subsequent experience of Orthic has served only to confirm the author's expectations.
The testimony of learners is unanimous as to its great simplicity in comparison with any phonetic system.
Teachers and school-masters in particular declare most strongly in its favour.
They find, as might naturally be expected, that besides bring more easily learnt, it has not, like phonetic systems, any tendency to spoil the learner's spelling.

Phonetic spelling in itself is undoubtedly a useful educational subject and a valuable aid in teaching correct pronunciation.
This argument is often advanced in favour of phonetic shorthand.
But it has been shown that there is no necessary connection between the two; and it is manifestly unreasonable to saddle shorthand with unnecessary difficulties in order to teach at the same time a subject which many people have no need or desire to learn.
In any case the work of both teacher and learner would be much simplified by keeping the two subjects separate.
