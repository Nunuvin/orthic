## Preface

It is now nearly a year since the publication of _Orthographic Cursive._
The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author's expectations,
and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.

The want of a brief and convenient title for the system has been very generally felt.
It has been decided to adopt the title of 'Orthic' in place of the somewhat cumbrous 'Orthographic Cursive.'

A society called the 'Cambridge Shorthand Society' has recently been started for the study and propagation of Orthic.
It has been placed under the management of Mr W. Stevens, of the Commercial and Technical Institute, Ranelagh Road, Ealing, W.
Manuscript magazines are, at present, circulated among the members,
and serve to provide practice in reading and writing the system.
It is hoped shortly to publish a magazine printed in Orthic,
and to establish a central school in London for the benefit of clerks and others who wish to perfect themselves in the reporting style,
and to utilise the system for business purposes.
In the meantime teaching for various centres can be arranged with Mr Stevens, the Principle of the Ealing Institute.

—H. L. CALLENDAR
