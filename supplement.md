## Preface

It is now nearly a year since the publication of _Orthographic Cursive._
The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author's expectations,
and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.

The want of a brief and convenient title for the system has been very generally felt.
It has been decided to adopt the title of 'Orthic' in place of the somewhat cumbrous 'Orthographic Cursive.'

A society called the 'Cambridge Shorthand Society' has recently been started for the study and propagation of Orthic.
It has been placed under the management of Mr W. Stevens, of the Commercial and Technical Institute, Ranelagh Road, Ealing, W.
Manuscript magazines are, at present, circulated among the members,
and serve to provide practice in reading and writing the system.
It is hoped shortly to publish a magazine printed in Orthic,
and to establish a central school in London for the benefit of clerks and others who wish to perfect themselves in the reporting style,
and to utilise the system for business purposes.
In the meantime teaching for various centres can be arranged with Mr Stevens, the Principle of the Ealing Institute.

—H. L. CALLENDAR

_June,_ 1892.


# Supplement to the Manual of Orthic

## Introduction

The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of [the methods of abbreviation given in the _Manual_ as 'Hints for the Reporting Style']({{M}}#hints-for-the-reporting-style) and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.

Some students appear to think that a phonetic system must necessarily be briefer and simpler than an orthographic.
Others appreciating the superior simplicity of the orthographic method are apt to wonder why shorthand was ever made phonetic.
It has therefore been thought necessary to explain these points more fully for the benefit of those who may not have read the author's previous publications on the subject.


## Advantages of the Orthographic Basis

An _Orthography,_ that is to say a definite standard of spelling, is the necessary groundwork of any practical system of writing.
It is essential, both for the sake of rapid automatic writing and to secure ease and certainty in reading, that each word should always be spelt in the same way.
In this way alone can it be written without conscious thought, and read without hesitation.

The author has insisted on this point, and illustrated it at some length in previous publications, particularly in the introduction to the _Manual of Cursive Shorthand[^1]_ (Phonetic).
Every word of that introduction will apply equally to the present system, except that it is orthographic and not phonetic.
The student who wishes thoroughly to master the principles of Orthic, and to learn how and why it differs from other systems of shorthand, will find in the introduction to the _Phonetic Manual_ much that is interesting and instructive, and that will be of material assistance to him.
The proof and explanation of the above statement, having been already given therein, need not be repeated here.
It is only necessary to point out its bearing on the question of an orthographic as opposed to a phonetic basis for shorthand.

[^1]: Published by C. J. Clay and Sons, price 2_s_.

### Simple, definite, and familiar

Every system of shorthand must in one sense be orthographic.
There must be a correct outline for each word.
Every departure from this rule entails a certain loss of efficiency, and a systematic violation of it results in hopeless confusion.

It is evidently much simpler, if possible, to adopt the commonly received orthography as the basis of spelling for a shorthand system, than to elaborate a new phonetic standard.
The common spelling is already familiar to everyone, and is a practically perfect standard in point of strictness and uniformity.
Phonetic spelling, on the other hand, is to many people extremely distasteful and difficult to learn.
It is, moreover, even when learnt, an uncertain and unsatisfactory standard[^2] owing to varieties and changes of pronunciation.

[^2]: See _A System of Phonetic Spelling,_ pp. 17 and 21, by H. L. Callendar, published by Clay and Sons, 1889, price 6_d_.

That is the main and decisive point.
The simplicity and definiteness obtained by adopting the orthographic basis make it far preferable for general use to the phonetic.
There are several minor advantages, however, which should not be overlooked.

### Easily represents names and foreign languages

A phonetic system is quite unable to cope with any peculiarities of spelling, or to give any adequate representation of proper names.
It is also very difficult to adapt to the pronunciation of a foreign language.
Orthic, as shown in the _Manual,_ can be [used, almost without change, for writing any foreign language that is spelt with the common alphabet.]({{M}}#application-to-foreign-languages)

### Longhand abbreviations directly usable

Another very practical advantage of Orthic is that all the familiar longhand abbreviations can be at once utilised.
The majority of the examples given in the list of ['Examples of Abbreviations'](#examples-of-abbreviations) are simply transliterations of those in common use, and being already familiar require no learning.

### Equal to any phonetic system

It is commonly urged in favour of phonetic spelling that so much is gained in point of shortness by the omission of mute and silent letters, and by using simple signs for diphthongs and other compound sounds.
This argument as applied to shorthand is somewhat misleading.
All phonetic methods of abbreviation, such as _tho_ for _though,_ _brot_ for _brought_ etc., in so far as they are convenient and clear, are naturally utilised in any orthographic system.
Common diphthongs and combinations are also naturally represented by simple curves.
The characters of the orthographic alphabet can also be grouped on the principle of representing similar sounds by similar signs, thus securing whatever advantages a phonetic system may claim in this respect.

### Solves the harder problems

From the inventor's point of view, the real advantage of a phonetic system lies in the fact that it is much easier _to construct._
The early inventors could not find sufficient material for their alphabets in the way of characters that would join easily and clearly.
They got out of the difficulty by rejecting what they called duplicate or superfluous letters, such as _c, j, q, x,_ and by omitting all the vowels, or expressing them by detached marks.
This was really only a method of cutting the Gordian knot, and could not result in the production of a system adequate and suitable for general use.
The comparative case of constructing a system on this basis is, however, undoubtedly the true explanation of the extraordinary prevalence of systems of this type.

It is much more difficult to find sufficient stenographic material for a _complete_ phonetic system, providing joined characters for both vowels and consonants.
The difficulty of constructing a complete _orthographic_ system is of the same kind, but greater, owing to the great number and variety of different combinations to be provided for.

As early as 1887 the author fully recognised the advantages of an orthographic basis in point of simplicity, and had made many unsuccessful attempts to construct such a system; but at the time of writing the introduction of the _Manual_ he did not _fully_ realise the difficulties that phonetic spelling presents to the majority of students.
He was therefore content to abandon his orthographic labours, and to acquiesce in the generally prevailing opinion (as expressed in the _Manual,_ p.&nbsp;19) that a system of shorthand to be simple, consistent and complete must be phonetic, since it is _almost impossible_ to make a system represent consistently and simply the endless variety of combinations in the common spelling.
A correction in the above passage suggested by two or three eminent shorthand authorities, conducted in striking out the word 'almost' before impossible.
The author however, having at length succeeded in solving the problem to his own satisfaction, is now of the opinion that he had somewhat over-rated the impossibility.

### No need to learn phonetic spelling

Very shortly after the publication of _Cursive,_ it became evident that the difficulties of the majority of learners were almost entirely phonetic, that the system was otherwise extremely simple and very easily acquired.
The author therefore set to work again in a more systematic way.
A most elaborate analysis was made of the common spelling of English and several foreign languages.
The relative frequencies and modes of occurrence of all the possible combinations of letters were tabulated.
By means of this table a great variety of different methods and arrangements of characters were tested and rejected, or emended and improved.
After about a year of trial and failure an alphabet was at length evolved, capable of satisfying all the conditions previously laid down.

Subsequent experience of Orthic has served only to confirm the author's expectations.
The testimony of learners is unanimous as to its great simplicity in comparison with any phonetic system.
Teachers and school-masters in particular declare most strongly in its favour.
They find, as might naturally be expected, that besides bring more easily learnt, it has not, like phonetic systems, any tendency to spoil the learner's spelling.

Phonetic spelling in itself is undoubtedly a useful educational subject and a valuable aid in teaching correct pronunciation.
This argument is often advanced in favour of phonetic shorthand.
But it has been shown that there is no necessary connection between the two; and it is manifestly unreasonable to saddle shorthand with unnecessary difficulties in order to teach at the same time a subject which many people have no need or desire to learn.
In any case the work of both teacher and learner would be much simplified by keeping the two subjects separate.


## Ordinary Style

The Ordinary Style of Orthic is intended for general use and for purposes of correspondence and communication between different writers of the system.
The rules have been made as simple and definite as possible, so that any word can be correctly written in one way only.
It is particularly desirable that writers should keep as far as possible to the ordinary style in correspondence, and that they should not introduce reporting abbreviations of their own devising.

Since the publication of the _Manual_ the [methods of abbreviation given under 'Hints for Reporting']({{M}}#hints-for-the-reporting-style) have been very thoroughly tested by experienced writers of the system.
Many of these methods have been found to be so convenient and safe for purposes of correspondence that it has been decided to admit them into the ordinary style.
The following list contains a fuller explanation and illustration of the abbreviations which have been thus admitted.

It should be observed that the use of these additional abbreviations is _optional._
Those who prefer it may continue to write [the full ordinary style as developed in the _Manual,_]({{M}}#ordinary-style) which is quite brief enough for general purposes.
But if they correspond with advanced writers of the system, they must be prepared to meet with any of the following methods of abbreviation.

Teachers are recommended to instruct their pupils thoroughly in the full ordinary style, before introducing them to the advanced style developed in this Supplement.
They should also make beginners write between double-ruled lines at first, as explained in the _Manual,_ ['The Two Sizes of Character.']({{M}}#the-two-sizes-of-character)
This is of great assistance in forming the characters neatly, and in distinguishing correctly between the two sizes.


## General Method of Abbreviation

The [general method of abbreviating Orthic as given in the _Manual_]({{M}}#the-general-method) is the same as that ordinarily employed in longhand, namely, to write the first syllable of a word and, if necessary, to indicate the termination by writing the last letter or two separated by a small interval from the rest of the word.
Experience has shown that abbreviations made in this way are at once the most suggestive and the most readily extemporised.
The free use of this method of abbreviation is rendered possible in Orthic by the full expression of vowels in the outlines.
In systems of shorthand which have no adequate means of expressing the vowels, it would obviously be quite inadmissible.

In correspondence, this method must of course be used with reason and moderation and with due regard to the context.
It should be restricted to very common words or to words frequently repeated and specially related to the subject of the letter.
In taking notes intended only for private use, it may much more freely employed.

Examples of abbreviations for common words such as may safely be used in correspondence are given in the list of ['Examples of Abbreviations.'](#examples-of-abbreviations)
The method of curtailment may be applied to short words as well as to long ones.
In the case of short words containing a characteristic long vowel of diphthong it is usually best to keep the vowel (e.g. _rea_ for _read,_ _rou_ for _round,_ _cou_ for _count_), but in the case of very common words for which abbreviations are already current in longhand, it is often better to follow the longhand usage (e.g. _rt_ for _right,_ _mst_ for _most,_ _pt_ for _part,_ _pnt_ for _point,_ _cd_ for _could_).
It may be remarked that, as in longhand, the same abbreviation may in some cases be used for two or even three different words provided they are different parts of speech such as would necessarily be distinguished by the context.
Thus _hd_ is used for _had_ and _head_ and also for the termination _-hood,_ _wd_ for _would_ and _world,_ _mst_ for _most_ and _must,_ _mt_ for _might_ and for the termination _-ment._
In most systems of shorthand this principle is applied, by the wholesale omission of vowels, to an altogether unwarrantable extent.
In Taylor's or Pitman's a single combination of consonants such as _ls_ may stand for any one of twenty or thirty different words.
The principle in itself is good and reasonable, but we would caution writers of Orthic against the abuse of it.


## Phraseography

Time is frequently saved and legibility increased by joining words together in phrases without lifting the pen.
This is a powerful method of abbreviation in the hands of experienced writers, and is specially applicable in the case of Orthic owing to its lineality and facility of joining.
Experience has shown, however, that beginners are apt to run riot with all sorts of impossible and useless phrases to the great detriment of the speed and legibility of their writing.
The number of possible and useful phrases is so great that it is impracticable to publish and exhaustive list showing what phrases may be used in the ordinary style.
The simplest and best general rule for a beginner to follow is _not to use_ phraseography at all in correspondence until he has made himself perfectly familiar with the system.


## Supra-Linear Writing

This signifies writing a word above the line, out of its natural position, to indicate the omission of a prefix.
It is a method of great simplicity and power if properly applied.

[Initial _th_ as explained in the _Manual_]({{M}}#replace-th--with-writing-higher) is already expressed in this way, supplying clear and systematic abbreviations for a very special class of common words peculiar to English.
It is found, however, that the use of this method may be very largely extended without any risk of clashing.
It will be observed that all the following applications of the method are merely special cases of the general method of [abbreviation 'by mode' as explained in the _Manual._]({{M}}#modes)

### Eve
The words:
{% assign words = "every evening event evident evil" | split:" " %}
{%for word in words %}
- _{{word}}_
{%endfor%}

and their derivatives are abbreviated by the _V_-Mode, in the same way as _ever,_ by omitting the _eve_ and writing the rest of the word above the line.

**Exception:** _Even_ is written _e’en,_ to distinguish it from _than_ or _then._

### Be
This prefix is peculiar to a special class of English words, and may also be expressed by writing above the line.

The word _be_ is expressed by a dot above the line; _been_ and _being_ by _n_ and straight _‑ing;_ the former will not be found to clash with _than._

### Per-, pro-, pre-
These prefixes, being Latin, will not clash with any of the above English prefixes, and may be expressed in the same way with great saving of time and space.

_Pre-_ and _pro-_ are distinguished from _per,_ if necessary, by retaining the vowels _e_ and _o._
The cases, however, in which it is necessary to make the distinction are very rare.

When any of these prefixes occur in the middle of a word after another prefix, as in the words _unbelief, compromise,_ etc., they are expressed by Mode (1), that is to say by writing the terminal portion of the word close above and to the right of the initial prefix.
In the prefixes _super, supra, hyper,_ the _per_ is similarly expressed.

The allied prefix _pri_ may be expressed in the same way as _pre_ in some common words. [TODO: See if List provides some examples, because none were given here.]

### Para, peri
These Greek prefixes may also be expressed by supra-linear writing for the same reason.
_Peri_ is distinguished by retaining the _i_; it may be regarded as a special case of _per._

_Examples_ of these prefixes will be found in the list of ['Examples of Abbreviations.'](#examples-of-abbreviations)

## Other Prefixes and Slurs
### Acqu
Written _aqu._

### Adj
Written _aj._

### Adv
Slurred into one large character compounded of _d_ and _v_ [as explained in the _Manual,_ 'Hints for Reporting,' 'Slurring.']({{M}}#slurring)

### Com, con
Expressed by a dot on the line written close in front of the word, as explained in the _Manual,_ 'Hints for Reporting.'
[Jeremy: As far as I can tell, this is not actually explained there. You could infer it, but it's not explained.]
In taking notes, the dot may generally be omitted or expressed by Mode (2).
In correspondence it should be retained.

In compound prefixes, such as _incom-, discom-,_ etc., the _com-_ or _con-_ is expressed by Mode (2).

### Circum
Written _cir_ followed by a short break to represent _cum._ _Circe_ is the the regular longhand abbreviation for the word _circumstance._

### Magna, magni
Written _m,_ the rest of the word being placed below to indicate the _g._ (Mode (3), _Manual,_ 'Hints.')

### Mb
May be written with a single character somewhat like _mp,_ but beginning and ending on the line. (See the list.)

### Mis-
Written _ms,_ omitting the _i._

### Nch, sch
These combinations may be written without an angle or break. (See _inch, such, school,_ in the list.)

### Tch
The _t_ may always be omitted in this combination.

### Trans
Written _trs,_ as in longhand.


## Terminations

In accordance with the general method terminations are indicated by writing the last letter or two detached from the rest of the word.
Thus the common terminations
{% assign words = "ent ence ency graph ism ship wise" | split:" "-%}
{%for word in words%}_‑{{word}},_ {%endfor%}
are written
{% assign words = "t ence cy ph m p se" | split:" "-%}
{%for word in words%}_‑{{word}},_ {%endfor%}
respectively.
(See the list.)

### Ness
This termination should be written _‑ess_ detached, by the general rule, and not _ns_ as given in the _Manual._
Detached _n_ and _ns_ can then be used, as in longhand, for the expression of the common terminations _‑ation_ and _‑ations._

### Ve, ‑ive
This common termination is expressed by a dot above and to the right of the word to indicate the _v._
([Mode (1), _Manual,_ 'Hints.']({{M}}#modes))
When the word is inflected the last letter of the inflection is substituted for the dot.
(See _gives, given, selves,_ etc. in the list.)

### Ge, ‑dge, ‑age
These and derived terminations are similarly expressed by a dot below and to the right to indicate the _g._
([Mode (3), _Manual,_ 'Hints.']({{M}}#modes)
See also _knowledge, agent,_ etc. in the list.)

### Gn, gram
Indicated by _n_ and _m_ respectively written below (Mode (3)) to indicate the _g,_ as in the termination _‑ight._
(See _foreign, sign,_ in the list.)

### Key
[Jeremy: As in the _Manual,_ the Reporting Specimen did not have a key. This section is my own contribution.]

**Notes on Reporting**

(page 1, line 1) The reporting style of Orthic is in no way essent(ial)ly dif(ferent) fr(om) the ord(inar)y (line 2) style.
There-is li(tt)le n(e)w t(o) learn and n(oth)ing to unlearn.
It’s simply an extension of-the same (l. 3) pr(inciple)s and methods of abbreviation, and-the acquirement of speed and facility is merely a (4) qu(estion) of prac(tise).

(5) The most important and generally useful method of abbreviation is the general method already (6) explained.
It may be very freely used in reporting with due regard to the context. (7)
Half the art of reporting depends on the *judicious* use of the context. (8)
The good reporter acquires an *instinct* which tells him how he may scribble and abbreviate (9) recklessly without fear of subsequent misreading.
Common or repeated words (10) may be very generally abbreviated but uncommon or rare words should be carefully written. (11)
It’s of no use to burden the memory with special abbreviations for rare words (12) however long and awkward they may be.
Beginners often waste a great deal of time (13) and ingenuity in devising special contractions for such words as _bijection,_ _trinitarianism,_ (14) _sesquipedalian,_ and-the like.
The absurdity of such-a proceeding is too obvious (15) to need comment.

#### Modes
(16) The use of modes (1) and (3) (except in the special cases (17) already given) should be almost entirely restricted to the expression of _V_ and _G_ respectively. (18)
Many students appear to have misunderstood the principles of their application
and some have even (19) gone so far as to write all words beginning with _p, b_ or _v_ above the line omitting (page 2, line 1) the initial letter.
This is manifestly absurd.
The initial letter of a word is (2) usually the most important for its identification and should therefore be retained — except in (3) one special case namely that of a com(mo)n prefix.
Such-a prefix being common to a large class (4) of words is a less use for purpose of identification and may therefore be (5) suitably expressed by the method of supra-linear writing.

(6) In-the middle of a short word _G_ or _V_ may be conveniently expressed by the (7) mode
as in _s<sup>re</sup>_ = severe, _re<sub>n</sub>_ = regain, _s<sub>t</sub>_ = sight, (8)
but in-the case of longer words
it's generally better to keep the _G_ or _V_ if it forms (9) part of-the first syllable or root of-the word,
and only to express it by mode (10) if it occurs in a subsequent syllable.
For instance it's better to write
_several_ = (11) _sev_ than _s<sup>ral</sup>_,
similarly _reg<sub>n</sub>_ = regulation,
_<sup>nev</sup>_ = benevolent not _<sup>n<sup>lent</sup></sup>_
(12) but in _abbr<sup>te</sup>_ = abbreviate,
_el<sup>te</sup>_ = elevate,
_intel<sub>ce</sub>_ = intelligence,
_rel<sub>n</sub>_ = religion
(13) the _V_ or _G_ would be aptly expressed by mode.

#### Slurring

(14) In addition to the common slurs given in the _Manual_ the fo(llo)wing (15) will be fou(nd) useful:

- double-wide M = man (compare double-wide D = td)
- double-wide M and y = many
- (16) w and double-wide M = woman
- u and double-wide M = human
- double-wide M and eef = mneef (??)
- double-wide M and ey = money
- (17) ct-blend = ct
- f hooked up at end = fs
- k hooked up at end like initial w = ks
- cl = chl
- clofm = chloroform [J: I originally thought this was "chroroform", and expected the L to be inside the CH to stay below the line of exit. In fact, this "chl" together with "fr(anything)" underscores that Callendar considered the direction the circle is traced rather than whether the circle is above or below the exiting line that distinguishes R from L.]


##### Short Vowels
(18) Short vowels may often be slurred especially in terminations,

- double-wide M and r = manner
- (19) upr = upper
- n-nl = national.

T may generally be slurred in-the terminations
ty (20) and th, thus duy = duty, wih = with, ohr = other.

(page 3, line 1) Examples of other slurs are;

- long O and g = orog (??)
- tmow = tomorrow
- (2) c long-ou r = counter
- ul = until
- i n s long-d = instead
- nst = next.


#### Repeated Letters
(3) Repeated letters may often be omitted when abbreviating especially if the termination contains (4) the last letter of-the root and can be joined.
This principle has always been freely used in rng-nt (??) abbreviations.
(5) Thus

- este = estate
- ulte = ultimate
- circe = circumstance
- instute = institute.

#### Other Suggestions
(6) It has been proposed to use the mode of writing below the line
(7) for the expression of-the common prefixes _de_ and _di,_ the latter being distinguished by retaining the _i._
(8) Thus 

- <sub>ifer</sub> = differ
- <sub>fer</sub> = defer
- <sub>isfun</sub> = dissatisfaction
- <sub>ft</sub> = defendant [J: I totally expected "defeat", which amply demonstrates the next point.]

(9) This method however should not be used in correspondence but restricted to private notes.

#### E and i
(10) E and i may often be distinguished without dotting the i by writing the letter more
(11) steeply than e. Compare

- illegib(le) with eligible
- inter with enter
- ill with ell.

#### Shading
(12) There can be no doubt that the device of shading or thickening a character
(13) is _not_ sound _for general use._
Some writers however are of opinion that it may occasionally be
(14) used with advantage in reporting.
If used it's most appropriately applied to express a combined _R_ or _L_
(15) thus [using capitals to represent shaded characters]

- Fme = fr(a)me,
- Coss = cross,
- pP = ppl,
- Pac = prac(tice),
- oD = old;
- (16) aTghr = altghr,
- Am = arm.

The method however is not to be generally recommended.


#### Lastly
(17) The most important rule of all in reporting practice is _never_ to use a mode or an
(18) abbreviation that causes hesitation or waste of time, not to worry about trifles; and to _practise_
(19) writing from dictation and transcribing till your notes become perfectly fluent and cursive and legible.
(20) A study of-the examples which follow will probably be more useful than many pages of hints.
